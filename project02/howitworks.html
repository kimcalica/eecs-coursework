        <p>
          Once a user goes on the Helping Hand Website and chooses the service they need, they will be prompted with Heelping Hand being to access their current location.
          Then they will select the amount they're willing to pay for that service. Once they confirm the details, everyone with the app in a one mile radius of the customer will be notified instantly.
          The first person to accept the job, gets the job and must be at the job location within fifteen minutes to complete the job. Once the worker completes the job, the payment will automatically go through or system.
        </p>
