        <h1> About us</h1>

          <p> We formed Helping Hand in 2019, as a way of bridging the gap between people having the need for instant service and people looking to get extra cash doing easy work locally.
              It all started one cold December morning in Evanston, IL. The founder of Helping Hand woke up to a foot of snow but did not have enough time to get ready, shovel and make his train down to Chicago.
              All snow-removal companies were busy servicing the whole commuinity. He thought, why couldn't a high-school kid serve my driveway while I get ready and I could make some money for doing it.
              At this moment, he thought that starting local was the need that civilians had.
              Starting local then surveyed the community of Evanston for different services that caused inconvenience due to their timeliness.
