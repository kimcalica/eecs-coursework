    <h1 class="card_title"> How It Works </h1>
    <h4 class="card_subtitle"> Weekly Drawings </h4>
    <p class="card_text">
      Zurila collects pocket change weekly from various sources Using the collection of money received,
      we distribute half of the money to a charity that we are partnering with for that particular month and half of the money
      being sent back to the actual donors. <br>
      We believe that people who give should be rewarded too! This was our motivatio in instilling our procedure of giving 50%
      of the money collected back to the donors through a raffle system.<br>
      For example, if $1000 are raised over a week, $500 will be given to the charity and the $500 will be raffled back to the donors.
      Three raffles will be doncuted with 50%, 30%, 20% of the pot being distributed accordingly to the winners each raffle through
      Venmo or Paypal.<br>
      Every amount of money given to Zurila will be kept track of with an individual's name and amount given in our database.
      Our raffle system is weighted based on donation amount. So someone who gave $0.75 has a higher probability of winning than
      someone who gave $0.20. <br>
